Sonic: Lock & Load is a hyper-fast, action packed first-person shooter based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games and built on GZDoom.

It draws inspiration from Sonic games, as well as titles like Sonic Robo Blast 2, ULTRAKILL and DOOM Eternal. It also features elements from other GZDoom mods and retro FPS games.

Sonic: Lock & Load is not fully completed yet, and development is progressing slowly. However, it aims to provide an extremely fun and thrilling experience reminiscent of old-school shooters, as well as their modern-day revivals.
