Sonic: Lock & Load is a hyper-fast stylish action first-person shooter based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games and built on GZDoom.

It's heavily inspired by the high-speed platforming of Sonic Robo Blast 2, the heavily movement-based FPS gameplay of ULTRAKILL and the stylish action of Devil May Cry.

The current version of Sonic: Lock & Load is v1.4 "Horizons", part of Season 1: Chaos.
