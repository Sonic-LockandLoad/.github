Sonic: Lock & Load is a Sonic the Hedgehog-based first-person shooter on the [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org) source port, currently a mod that requires DOOM 2's IWAD.

Sonic: Lock & Load is free software under the 3-clause BSD license.

It's not really based on any kind of Sonic game in particular, instead taking inspiration from the entire franchise.

It's also currently very unfinished, and development is kind of slow.

Sonic: Lock & Load is a project by [Arsalan Kazmi](https://github.com/that1m8head).
